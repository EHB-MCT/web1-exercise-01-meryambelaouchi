    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li> 4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups (106g) Dutch-process cocoa</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon espresso powder, optional for enhanced flavor</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>16 tablespoons (227g) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 1/4 cups (447g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (180g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>2 cups (340g) chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly grease a 9" x 13" pan. If you plan to turn the whole sheet of brownies
            out of the pan at once, grease the pan, line it with parchment, and grease the parchment.</li>
        <li>Crack the 4 eggs into a bowl, and beat them at medium speed with the cocoa, salt, baking powder, espresso
            powder, and vanilla for about 1 minute, or until smooth. You can do this while you're melting your butter
            (next step).</li>
        <li>Add the hot butter/sugar mixture to the egg/cocoa mixture, stirring until smooth.</li>
        <li>Add the flour and chips, stirring until smooth. Again, adding the chips helps produce a shiny top crust.
        </li>
        <li>Spoon the batter into a lightly greased 9" x 13" pan.</li>
        <li>Bake the brownies for 28 to 32 minutes, until the edges feel set, and the center should look very moist, but
            not uncooked. When testing to see if brownies are done, take a toothpick or the tip of a sharp knife and
            carefully poke it into the center of the pan, digging around just enough to see the interior. You should see
            moist crumbs, but no uncooked batter. Yes, you'll be left with a small divot in the center of your brownies;
            just cut around it when you're cutting the brownies into squares. </li>
        <li>Remove them from the oven and cool on a rack before cutting and serving. </li>
        <li>Store any leftovers, well-wrapped, at room temperature for 5 to 6 days. Freeze for longer storage.</li>

    </ol>
